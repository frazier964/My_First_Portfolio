    <h1>Welcome to My First Portfolio</h1>
    
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm excited to share my journey in web development with you. This is my first portfolio website, and I'm learning HTML basics to create engaging and interactive web experiences.</p>
    
    <p>Web development has become a passion of mine, and I'm dedicated to mastering the fundamentals before moving on to more advanced concepts. Every line of code is a step forward in my learning journey.</p>
    
    <h2>My Learning Goals</h2>
    <p>I'm focused on building a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Understanding these core technologies will enable me to create beautiful and functional websites that provide great user experiences.</p>
    
    <p>Through practice and continuous learning, I aim to develop skills that will help me contribute meaningfully to web development projects and eventually build sophisticated web applications.</p>
